# Face Detection App

## Description
This is a Python-based face detection application using OpenCV and Tkinter. The application allows users to log in or register new users with a webcam-based face capture system. It features a GUI built with Tkinter and integrates OpenCV for real-time webcam processing.

## Features
- Real-time face detection using OpenCV
- User login and registration system
- Graphical user interface (GUI) using Tkinter
- Webcam integration for capturing user images

## Installation
### Prerequisites
Ensure you have Python installed on your system. You can install the required dependencies using:
```bash
pip install opencv-python numpy pillow
```

## Usage
To run the application, execute:
```bash
python main.py
```

## File Structure
- `main.py` - Main script to run the application
- `util.py` - Contains utility functions for creating GUI elements (ensure this file exists in your project)

## Dependencies
- Python 3.x
- OpenCV (`cv2`)
- Tkinter (built-in with Python)
- PIL (`Pillow`)


## Future Improvements
- Implement actual face detection and recognition
- Store registered user data
- Improve GUI aesthetics
